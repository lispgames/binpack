;; based on Chazelle's "Bottom-Left Bin-Packing Heuristic: An
;; Efficient Implementation" (
;; https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/blbinpacking.pdf ),
;; with heuristics from http://clb.demon.fi/files/RectangleBinPack.pdf
;; and with options for controlling shape of packing

;;; goals for shaping heuristics:
;;
;; for a given set of rects, we want them efficiently packed into some
;; rectangle, but might not care about the actual size/shape of the
;; rectangle beyond some much larger constraints like maximum image or
;; texture sizes. Just packing into that maximum might end up with a
;; wide/flat packing, or one that mostly uses 2 edges and leaves the
;; middle empty.
;;
;; instead, we give options for biasing the packing while maintaining
;; the "bottom left" constraint, and some modifiers for common
;; constraints like "multiple of X" widths etc.
;;
;;; uses cases:
;;   fixed width or height, pack into minimum for other dimension
;;
;;   pack into minimal square, limited to 4096 or whatever in either
;;   dimension
;;
;;   same as above, but with width limited to multiples of 4 or 8
;;
;;   pack into minimal rectangle with power-of-2 dimensions?
;;

;;; biasing heuristics:
;; given a starting width/height (estimated from total size of rects
;; if possible, or specified manually), and quantization (multiples of
;; 8 etc) for each axis, we add a penalty to the original packing
;; heuristic for any packing which would extend the current
;; (quantized) width or height, and further penalize those that would
;; push the aspect ratio further from that of the starting dimensions.
;;
;; or possibly bias based on amount of area added to total size when a
;; packing extends past current extents? possibly scaled by starting
;; aspect ratio if maintaining that is desired? added area without
;; aspect ratio would probably be best for power-of-2 packings

;;; optimization options
;; (ideally try to make them interruptable, for example add a "stop
;;  and return best result so far" restart, so user can let it run as
;;  long as they want, or interrupt it early)
;;
;; retry pack with fixed sizes a few sizes smaller than final pack?
;; (size affects packing, so can't binary search or stop when it
;; fails, have to do linear search and try a few past first failure in
;; case they get luckier)
;;
;; pack, then remove anything above or to right of a gap, then repack
;; those (possibly with different heuristics/sorting/etc)
;;
;; retry pack a few times with some randomization of sorting,
;; heuristic, and packing choices?
;;
;; variant of full retry: add some restart points partway to allow
;; backtracking, with some estimate of quality of partial pack for
;; doing a search (max dimensions, gaps/density, ?)

;;; other features to add:
;;
;; multipage packing?
;;
;; pack-from-center? (divide into quadrants and pack all 4 at once
;; from origin (possibly with options for overlapping axis?))
;;
;; mode that reuses the search to try to pack multiple rects of same
;; width at once?
